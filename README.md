## Agile Methodology

Agile methodology is a flexible and iterative approach to project management and software development. The process can be divided into the following chunks:

1. **Divide into Chunks**
   - **Mapping processes**
     - Optimize Process with the right combination of technologies
       - **App design together with the client**
         - **App construction and implementation**
           - **Evaluation and Monitoring**
